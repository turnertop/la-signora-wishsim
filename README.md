A Genshin Impact Wish Simulator built with React.

Still needs some work!


TO DO LIST:
1. MATH/PROBABILITY/STATS FOR RNG FOR WISHES
- 5 star has 0.6%
- 4 star has 5.1%
- 3 star has 94.3%
- every 10 wish is a 4 star
- 76 - 20% 5 star
- 77 - 13% 5 star
- 78 - 9% 5 star
- 79 - 6% 5 star
- 80 - 4% 5 star
- 81 - 3% 5 star
- 82 - 2% 5 star
- 83 - 1% 5 star
- 84 - 1% 5 star
- 85 - back to 0.6%
- 90 - 100% 5 star
2. Add video wish background
3. Adjust CSS styling to look realistic
4. Assign states to currency and have those states correlate with the global website state
5. Add state that forces requirement of currencies
6. Add alternative wishes for single wish and 10-pull wish(3 star, 4 star and 5 star) and have its relative probabilities align with the count ((fuck me))
